This is a package that can calculate the temperature of water in the Southern Floridian waters depending on the depth. 
The constant, 30 degrees Celcius, represents the average temperature in this area. Users can input the surface temperature and use the 
function GTG() to return a table of temperatures at different depths in the sea. The user can also input a specified depth along with surface temperature in degrees Celcius to
recieve the temperature.
